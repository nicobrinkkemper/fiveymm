# About 5YMM

> ## What is 5YMM?
  YMM is a (kinda) yearly celebration of Super Mario Maker, coordinated by Kiavik. It's a community project where some of the game's best known makers, as well as lesser known creators with some bright ideas, come together to collaborate and peer review each other's levels. And now we're releasing those levels in weekly batches. So be sure to come back here every Sunday!

> ## So what kind of levels are these?
  Anything goes! Platformers, music levels, shooters, puzzles... each maker plays on their own strengths to make an as accomplished, original and polished level they can. If you look into the weekly batches here on this website, you'll find short descriptions as well as category tags and a difficulty rating. This way you should be able to find something that suits you.

> ## How can I get in touch?
  At the bottom of every page, you'll find a link to Kiavik's Discord, as well as our YouTube channel. So if you have any questions or just want to see what's going on, mosey on over.
